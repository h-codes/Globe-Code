Don’t forget to visit the modern public gardens, ‘Gardens by the Bay’ and watch the musical lights attraction that typically takes place at 9pm each night - a symphony of musically coordinated lights amongst the starry sky and nature, it’s not something to be missed. Overall, Singapore is perfect for a 3-4 day holiday trip with friends and family. There’s plenty to discover in this small but mighty city-state.</p>
